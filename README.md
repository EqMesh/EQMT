# EqMesh – EQMT Position Token System

This repository contains the EQMT on-chain position system.

## the Onchain Branch
is used to reflect the state of items when deployed to the blockchain.
the page [github.com/EqMesh/EQMT](https://github.com/EqMesh/EQMT) is used to accurately reflect the state of the published Tokens.

## Deployment (current & and history)
the current/live token and it's parents can always be checked via [contracts.json](https://www.eqmesh.com/token/EQMT/meta/contracts.json)
this makes it easy to verify on-chain transactions even if the token has ben replaced.

## deployment (v0.2) on Ethereum Mainnet
there was a larger development gap, with the launch of EQMT 0.2 all transactions will now be run trough the token chain
- initial Production deployment of 0.2 on [Ethereum Mainnet (1)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1988cb209d705f49982e1a13842a7b684a281e58) at ```0x1988cB209d705F49982E1a13842a7b684A281e58```
